# Query Function Fix - getTransactionsByUser

## Problem
```
Error getting user transactions: RejectError: The replica returned a rejection error:
Canister has no query method 'getTransactionsByUser'
```

## Root Cause
The deployed canister doesn't have the `getTransactionsByUser` function exported as a query method. Even though the function exists in the backend code, it needs to be redeployed to the canister.

## Solution
The backend code already has the correct query function definition:
```motoko
public query func getTransactionsByUser(userAddress : Text) : async [Transaction]
```

But the deployed canister needs to be updated with this function.

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Deploy with Script
```bash
chmod +x deploy-fixes.sh
./deploy-fixes.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Start DFX replica
dfx start --background --clean

# Deploy the canister
dfx deploy multi_chain_funding_backend

# Test the functions
dfx canister call multi_chain_funding_backend getTransactionsByUser '("0x23f8f22bc0ed154a9ea7cb581c6e15ed93be9708")'
```

### Option 3: Upgrade Existing Canister
If you want to keep the same canister ID:
```bash
dfx canister install multi_chain_funding_backend --mode upgrade
```

## Functions That Need to be Query Functions

The following functions are already defined as query functions in the backend code but need to be deployed:

1. ✅ `getAllTransactions` - Query function
2. ✅ `getTransactionsByUser` - Query function  
3. ✅ `getTransaction` - Query function
4. ✅ `getTransactionStats` - Query function
5. ✅ `getFixedReceiptAddress` - Query function
6. ✅ `getRewardAmount` - Query function

## New Functions Added

1. ✅ `markAsPaid` - New function for marking transactions as paid
2. ✅ `PAID` status - New transaction status

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Test My Tokens Section**:
   - Connect a wallet
   - Check if transactions appear in "My Tokens" section

2. **Test Admin Panel**:
   - Go to admin panel
   - Check if "Mark as Paid" button works
   - Verify dates display properly

3. **Test Query Functions**:
   ```bash
   # Test getAllTransactions
   dfx canister call multi_chain_funding_backend getAllTransactions
   
   # Test getTransactionsByUser
   dfx canister call multi_chain_funding_backend getTransactionsByUser '("USER_ADDRESS")'
   
   # Test markAsPaid
   dfx canister call multi_chain_funding_backend markAsPaid '("tx_1")'
   ```

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ My Tokens section will show user transactions
- ✅ Admin panel will show proper amounts and dates
- ✅ Mark as Paid button will work
- ✅ No more "Canister has no query method" errors

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors after deployment:

1. **Check Canister ID**: Make sure your frontend is using the correct canister ID
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Refresh the page and clear cache
3. **Check Console Logs**: Look for any remaining errors in browser console
4. **Verify Deployment**: Test the canister functions directly with DFX

The issue is simply that the backend code needs to be deployed to the canister. Once deployed, all functionality should work correctly.
