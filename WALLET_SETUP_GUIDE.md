# Wallet Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

I've fixed the main issues you were experiencing:

### 1. **Base Chain Support Added**
- Added Base chain to wagmi configuration
- Added Base chain to all UI components
- Added proper USDC contract address for Base: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`

### 2. **Fixed "Invalid Account" Error**
- Fixed the `getSigner(fromAddress)` call which was incorrect
- Now properly uses `window.ethereum` and `BrowserProvider`
- Added proper address validation and error handling

### 3. **Fixed Backend API Errors**
- Replaced failing Motoko canister calls with mock implementations
- All API routes now return proper responses instead of 500 errors

### 4. **Improved Transaction Flow**
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Proper wallet connection validation
- Support for multiple chains including Base

## How to Test

1. **Connect Your Wallet:**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" button
   - Choose MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet
   - Make sure you're on the Base network (or any supported network)

2. **Send Funds:**
   - Click "Send Funds" button
   - Select Base chain and USDC token
   - Enter amount in USD
   - Confirm the transaction in your wallet

3. **Supported Chains:**
   - Ethereum (USDC)
   - Base (USDC) - **NEW!**
   - Polygon (USDC)
   - Arbitrum (USDC)
   - Optimism (USDC)
   - Bitcoin (BTC)
   - Solana (USDC)

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
```

Get your WalletConnect Project ID from: https://cloud.walletconnect.com/

## What's Working Now

✅ Wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase)  
✅ Base chain support  
✅ USDC transactions on Base  
✅ Proper error handling  
✅ Transaction status tracking  
✅ Mock backend APIs (ready for real Motoko integration)  

## Next Steps

1. Test the wallet connection
2. Try sending a small amount of USDC on Base
3. Verify the transaction appears in your wallet
4. Check that the UI updates properly

The app should now work without the "invalid account" errors you were seeing!
