# Stripe Card-Only Payment Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Amazon Pay and Cash App Pay options were showing in the Stripe payment interface, and there was a Stripe API error about conflicting payment method configurations.

**Solution**: Updated Stripe configuration to only allow card payments and removed automatic payment methods.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. API Route Update (`app/api/stripe/create-payment-intent/route.ts`)
**Before:**
```typescript
automatic_payment_methods: {
  enabled: true,
},
```

**After:**
```typescript
payment_method_types: ['card'],
```

### 2. Payment Component Update (`components/stripe-payment.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
<PaymentElement
  options={{
    layout: 'tabs',
  }}
/>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<PaymentElement
  options={{
    layout: 'tabs',
    paymentMethodTypes: ['card'],
  }}
/>
```

## 🎯 Result

Now when users select "Credit Card" as their payment method, they will only see:
- ✅ **Card input fields** (Card number, expiry, CVC)
- ❌ **No Amazon Pay option**
- ❌ **No Cash App Pay option**
- ❌ **No other payment methods**

## 🧪 Testing

The payment interface should now:
1. **Only show card input fields** when Stripe is selected
2. **Work with all test cards** (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.)
3. **No longer show the Stripe API error** about conflicting payment methods
4. **Process payments successfully** with card details only
