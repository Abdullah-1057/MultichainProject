# Backend Query Function Fix

## Problem
The admin panel is showing this error:
```
Error getting all transactions: RejectError: The replica returned a rejection error:
Canister has no query method 'getAllTransactions'
```

## Root Cause
The `getAllTransactions`, `getTransactionsByUser`, and `getTransaction` functions in the Motoko backend were defined as regular functions instead of query functions. Query functions are required for read-only operations that don't modify state.

## Solution Applied
I've updated the backend.mo file to make these functions query functions:

### Changes Made:
1. **getAllTransactions**: Changed from `public func` to `public query func`
2. **getTransactionsByUser**: Changed from `public func` to `public query func`  
3. **getTransaction**: Changed from `public func` to `public query func`

### Updated Function Signatures:
```motoko
// Before (causing the error)
public func getAllTransactions() : async [Transaction]

// After (fixed)
public query func getAllTransactions() : async [Transaction]
```

## Next Steps - Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: Using DFX (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Start DFX replica
dfx start --background --clean

# 2. Deploy the updated backend
dfx deploy multi_chain_funding_backend

# 3. Get the new canister ID
dfx canister id multi_chain_funding_backend

# 4. Test the fix
dfx canister call multi_chain_funding_backend getAllTransactions
```

### Option 2: Manual DFX Commands
```bash
# If you have an existing canister, upgrade it:
dfx canister install multi_chain_funding_backend --mode upgrade --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/multi_chain_funding_backend.wasm

# Or deploy fresh:
dfx deploy multi_chain_funding_backend
```

### Option 3: Using the Deployment Script
I've created a `deploy-backend.sh` script that automates the process:
```bash
chmod +x deploy-backend.sh
./deploy-backend.sh
```

## Update Frontend Configuration
After deployment, update the canister ID in your frontend:

1. **Get the new canister ID**:
   ```bash
   dfx canister id multi_chain_funding_backend
   ```

2. **Update the frontend**:
   - Update `lib/motoko-backend-real.ts` line 70:
     ```typescript
     private canisterId: string = "YOUR_NEW_CANISTER_ID";
     ```

3. **Or use environment variable**:
   ```typescript
   private canisterId: string = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_CANISTER_ID || "y65zg-vaaaa-aaaap-anvnq-cai";
   ```

## Verification
After deployment, test the admin panel:
1. Go to `/admin` in your frontend
2. The transactions should now load without errors
3. You should see the transaction data from your canister

## Why This Fix Works
- **Query functions** are read-only and don't require consensus
- They can be called directly from the frontend without going through the update mechanism
- They're faster and more efficient for data retrieval
- The Internet Computer treats them as "query" calls rather than "update" calls

## Additional Notes
- The backend already has data stored (as shown in your image)
- This fix only changes how the data is accessed (query vs update)
- No data will be lost during the upgrade
- The canister will continue to work with existing data

## Troubleshooting
If you still get errors after deployment:
1. Check that the canister ID is correct
2. Verify the canister is running: `dfx canister status multi_chain_funding_backend`
3. Check the canister logs: `dfx canister logs multi_chain_funding_backend`
4. Test with DFX CLI: `dfx canister call multi_chain_funding_backend getAllTransactions`
